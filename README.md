Fringe projection profilometry for additive manufacturing

## Overview

**Phase_AM** is an open-source python package developed for researchers, and engineers in metrology and additive manufacturing. The package provides a customizable and intuitive implementation of the fringe projection profilometry method for monitoring geometry of additivly manufactured products. We want to help the $${\color{red}\textbf{AM}}$$ community to effectively qualify the printing process.
